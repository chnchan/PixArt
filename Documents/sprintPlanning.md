### Discord meeting on Tues (11/5) Recap
- UI Views (code and storyboard) for Pixel Art Maker (use a “view” for placeholder, will discuss how to implement the implementation starting week 2), UI Views (code and storyboard) for the social media portion by end of this week.
- Fluid animation / transition. 
- Note: Try to make every view controller into its own storyboard so we don’t run into conflicting git pushes.

### In person meeting on Thurs (11/7) Recap
- One person will do the UIs design. Otherwise, the style will be all over the place.
