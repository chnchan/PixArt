### Discord meeting on Tues (11/5) Recap
- UI Views (code and storyboard) for Pixel Art Maker (use a “view” for placeholder, will discuss how to implement the implementation starting week 2), UI Views (code and storyboard) for the social media portion by end of this week.
- Fluid animation / transition. 
- Note: Try to make every view controller into its own storyboard so we don’t run into conflicting git pushes.

### In person meeting on Thurs (11/7) Recap
- One person will do the UIs design. Otherwise, the style will be all over the place.
- Updated communication method:If you know something doesn’t work or needs to be completed, add it to TODOS in discord. (add it when you stop working)Write down files you will be working on on discord to prevent git conflicts.
